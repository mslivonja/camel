Comments:
    Only sites associated to customer, and with access connectivity
    In Granite we will associate each customer with a set of sites. (Customer names need to be manually aligned)
    Granite API provides a customer.getSites() function that can be used to return a list of site names
    For each site, there will be only one access path, so in the same query all details will be responded.s)
    Once the access link is selected, all the other attributes/objects can be completed in the EOC GUI
